# AutoSched – AI-Powered Presentation Scheduling Web Application

AutoSched is an AI-powered web-based scheduling platform developed to automate and streamline the process of scheduling academic presentations in educational institutions. Traditional scheduling methods often result in resource conflicts, such as double-booking venues or assigning unavailable examiners. AutoSched solves this by providing a centralized, intelligent system that ensures every presentation is scheduled without conflicts, based on examiner availability, venue capacity, and presentation time slot overlaps.
